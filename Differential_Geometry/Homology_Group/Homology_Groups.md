# Homology Groups of Simplicial Complexes 

## Chain, Cycle and Boundary

*Definition*: With the following notations

<center>

|Object|Symbol|
|:-:|:-:|
|$i$th oriented $r$-simplex|$\sigma_{r,i}$|
|$n$-dimensional simplicial complex|$K$|
|Number of $r$-simplexes in $K$|$I_r$|

</center>
    
- **$r$-Chain**: A linear combination of all oriented $r$-simplexes in $K$

    $$
    c = \sum_{i=1}^{I_r} c_i \sigma_{r,i}, \quad 
    c_i \in \Z
    $$

    - **Coefficients of an $r$-chain**: the integers $c_i$
    
- **$r$-Chain group $C_r(K)$**: The *free Abelian group* consisting of all $r$-chains, which is generated by all oriented $r$-simplexes
    
    The group multiplication is given by:

    $$
    \left.
    \begin{align*}
        c = \sum_i c_i \sigma_{r,i} \\ 
        c' = \sum_i c'_i \sigma_{r,i}
    \end{align*}
    \right\} \Rightarrow
    c + c' = \sum_i (c_i + c'_i) \sigma_{r,i}
    $$

    <div class="remark">

    *Remark*: Obviously $C_r(K) \cong \Z^{I_r}$.

    *Verifying group structure:*

    - Existence of identity: 
        
        $$ 0 = \sum_i 0 \, \sigma_{r,i} $$
    
    - Existence of inverse: 

        $$
        c = \sum_i c_i \sigma_{r,i} \Rightarrow
        -c = \sum_i (-c_i) \sigma_{r,i}
        $$
    
    ----

- **Boundary $\partial_r \sigma_r$ of an oriented $r$-simplex $\sigma_r = (p_0 ... p_r)$**:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
        \partial_r \sigma_r &\equiv
        \sum_{i=0}^r (-1)^i (p_0 ... \cancel{p_i}... p_r)
        \quad (r > 0)
        \\
        \partial_0 \sigma_0 &\equiv 0
    \end{align*}
    $$

    *Example*:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
        \partial_1 (p_0 p_1) &= p_1 - p_0 \\
        \partial_2 (p_0 p_1 p_2) &=
        (p_1 p_2) - (p_0 p_2) + (p_0 p_1)
    \end{align*}
    $$
    
    *Remark*: 
    
    - $\partial_r \sigma_r$ (or simply $\partial \sigma_r$) is an $(r-1)$-chain (when $r>0$).
    
    - $\partial_r$ (or simply $\partial$) can be regarded as a **boundary operator**, which is a *homomorphism* acting *linearly* on simplexes contained in an $r$-chain $c \in C_r(K)$:

        $$
        \partial_r: C_r(K) \to C_{r-1}(K)
        $$

        $$
        \partial c \equiv \partial \left(
            \sum_i c_i \sigma_{r,i}
        \right)
        = \sum_i c_i (\partial \sigma_{r,i})
        $$
    
- **Chain complex $C(K)$ associated with $K \, (\dim{K} = n)$:**

    $$
    0 \xrightarrow{i} C_n(K) 
    \xrightarrow{\partial} C_{n-1}(K)
    \xrightarrow{\partial} \cdots
    % \xrightarrow{\partial} C_1(K)
    \xrightarrow{\partial} C_0(K)
    \xrightarrow{\partial} 0
    $$

- **$r$-Cycle group $Z_r(K)$**: the *kernel* of the boundary operator $\partial_r$, which is a *subgroup* of $C_r(K)$.

    $$
    Z_r(K) = \ker{\partial_r}
    = \{c \in C_r(K) \mid \partial_r c = 0\}
    $$

    - **$r$-Cycle**: An element in $Z_r(K)$, i.e. an $r$-chain *"without boundary"*
    
    *Remark*: We have defined that all points (0-simplexes) have no boundary. Therefore $Z_0(K) = C_0(K)$ 

- **$r$-Boundary group $B_r(K)$**: the *image* of the boundary operator $\partial_{r+1}$, which is also a *subgroup* of $C_r(K)$.
    
    $$
    B_r(K) = \begin{cases}
        0 & r = 0 \\
        \im{\partial_{r+1}} & r \ge 1
    \end{cases}
    $$

    - **$r$-Boundary**: An element in $B_r(K)$, i.e. an $r$-chain which is the boundary of some $(r+1)$-chain

    <div class="remark">

    *Remark*: Since the highest dimension of chains in $K$ is $n$, we *define* $B_n(K) = 0$

    </div>

<div class="result">

*Theorem*: (Boundaries have no boundary)

- $\partial_{r+1} \circ \partial_r = 0$
- *Corollary*: $B_r(K) \lhd Z_r(K)$

</div>

----

*Proof*:

- This follows immediately from the fact that "boundaries have no boundary", since $Z_r(K)$ is the set of $r$-chains "without boundary". 

- Note that $Z_r$ is Abelian, thus any of its subgroups are normal. $\blacksquare$

## Homology Groups

We study homology groups since they are topologically invariant.

*Definition*:

- **$r$-th homology group (同调群) $H_r(K)$** $(0 \le r \le n)$:
    
    $$
    H_r(K) \equiv Z_r(K) / B_r(K)
    $$

- **Homology classes**: Elements in $H_r(K)$

<div class="remark">

*Remark*: 

- The equivalence relation used here is: 

    $$
    z' \sim z :\Leftrightarrow z' - z \in B_r(K)
    $$

- Any boundary $b$ is equivalent to $0$, since $b - 0 \in B_r(K)$

- A homology group is a *finitely generated Abelian* group, but *not necessarily free*.

### Group structure of $H_r(K)$

We prefer to define $H_r(K)$ with *integer* coefficients (in front of the generators of the group), denoted by $H_r(K;\Z)$ ($\Z$ is usually omitted). 

It is also possible to use $\mathbb{R}$-coefficients (obtaining $H_r(K;\mathbb{R})$) or $\Z_2$-coefficients (obtaining $H_r(K;\Z_2)$). 

<div class="result">

*Theorem*: (Homology groups are topological invariants)

Let $X, Y$ be two topological spaces homeomorphic to each other. Let $(K,f), (L,g)$ be triangulations of $X, Y$ respectively. Then

$$
H_r(K) \cong H_r(L), \quad r = 0,1,2,...
$$

- *Corollary*: Let $(K,f), (L,g)$ be any two triangulations of the same topological space $X$. Then

    $$
    H_r(K) \cong H_r(L), \quad r = 0,1,2,...
    $$

</div>

<div class="remark">

*Remarks*: The theorem tells us that:

- Homology group of one topological space is *independent of* the triangulation used;
- Homology groups of two *homeomorphic* topological spaces are *isomorphic*  ("the same").

*Theorem*: Let $K$ be a *connected* simplicial complex. Then

H_0(K) \cong \Z
