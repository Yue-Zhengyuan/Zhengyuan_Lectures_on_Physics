# Direct and Semi-Direct Product

*Definition*: Let $F, G$ be two groups.

- **Direct product group** $F \times G$: Its elements are denoted by

    $$
    (f,g) \qquad f \in F,\ g \in G
    $$

    The group multiplication is defined straightforwardly as

    $$
    (f_1,g_1) (f_2,g_2) = (f_1 f_2, g_1 g_2)
    $$

- **Semi-direct product group** $F \rtimes G$:
