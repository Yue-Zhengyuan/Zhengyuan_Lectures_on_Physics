# Abelian (Commutative) Groups

*Definition*:

- **Abelian (commutative) group**: A group in which *all elements commute*.

*Notation notes*: For Abelian groups, we shall use additive notation instead of the usual multiplicative notation:

| General<br>Group | Abelian<br>Group |
| :--------------: | :--------------: |
|       $1$        |       $0$        |
|     $g^{-1}$     |       $-g$       |
|    $g_1 g_2$     |   $g_1 + g_2$    |
|  $g_1 g_2^{-1}$  |   $g_1 - g_2$    |
|      $g^n$       |       $ng$       |

## Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

*Definition*: Here we define some special Abelian groups

- **Finitely generated Abelian group**: An *Abelian* group $G$ *generated* by a *finite* number of its elements $x_1, ..., x_r$ according to the formula

    $$
    n_1 x_1 + \cdots + n_r x_r ,\quad 
    x_i \in G, n_i \in \mathbb{Z}, 1 \le i \le r
    $$

- **Generator of group $G$**: $\{x_1, ..., x_r\}$; the generators themselves commute with each other.

    <div class="remark">

    *Remark*: In any group $G$, we can always pick out commuting elements (at least we have the identity and any other one element) and construct an Abelian subgroup $H$ of $G$.

    </div><br>

    - **Linearly independent generators**: If the identity 0 can only be generated by setting $n_1 = \cdots = n_r = 0$, i.e.

        $$
        n_1 x_1 + \cdots + n_r x_r = 0 
        \Leftrightarrow
        n_1 = \cdots = n_r = 0
        $$

        the $r$ generators are then said to be linearly independent.

- **Free Abelian group**: Abelian groups finitely generated by *linearly independent generators*.
    
    - **Rank**: number of linearly independent generators of a free Abelian group

- **Cyclic group (循环群)**: Abelian group $G$ generated by only *one* element $x$
    
    $$
    G = \{0, \pm x, \pm 2x, ...\}
    $$

    - **Infinite cyclic group**: if $N x = 0$ can only be satisfied by $N = 0$, the cyclic group will contain an infinite number of elements. 

        *Remark*: These groups are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

    - **Finite cyclic group**: if the order of the generator $x$ is a finite integer, the cyclic group will contain a finite number of elements. 

        *Remark*: Finite cyclic groups generated by an generator of order $N$ are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_N$.

<div class="result">

*Theorem*: (**Fundamental theorem of finitely generated Abelian groups**)

Let $G$ be a finitely generated Abelian group (*not necessarily free*) generated by $m$ generators. Then

$$
G \cong 
\mathbb{Z}^r \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_p}, \quad
\mathbb{Z}^r \equiv \underbrace{\mathbb{Z} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}}_r
$$

where $r \ge 0, m = r + p$.

*Remark*: 

- $r$ is called the **rank** of the group $G$
- We can further prove that $k_1, ..., k_p$ are powers of (not necessarily distinct) *prime numbers*.
