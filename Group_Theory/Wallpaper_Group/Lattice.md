# Lattice and Space Group

Choosing $n$ basis vectors $t_1,...,t_n$ in $\R^n$; an **$n$-dimensional (Bravais) lattice** $T$ is a subgroup of $\R^n$ given by linear combinations of the basis vectors with *integral* coefficients:

$$
T = \{m_1 t_1 + \cdots m_n t_n \mid
m_1,...,m_n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

It is isomorphic to a subgroup of the full translation group of $\R^n$

$$
T \cong \{\tau_{m_1 t_1 + \cdots m_n t_n} \mid
m_1,...,m_n \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$

which is also the translation subgroup of the symmetry group of the lattice. 

The lattice may have other symmetry operations that leave the origin invariant (i.e. the *point group* $G_0$ of the lattice). The collection of all these point operations and the discrete translations forms the **space group** in $\R^n$.
