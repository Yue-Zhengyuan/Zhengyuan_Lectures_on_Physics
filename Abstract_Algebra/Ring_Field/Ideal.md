# Ideal and Quotient Ring

The concepts of normal subgroups and quotient groups correspond to the concepts of *ideals* and *quotient rings* in the theory of rings.

## Ideals

*Definition*: Let $R$ be a ring.

- **Ideal** of $R$: a subring $H$ of $R$ (denoted by $H \lhd R$) such that

    $$
    \forall x \in R, h \in H:
    (xh \in H) \land (hx \in H)
    $$
