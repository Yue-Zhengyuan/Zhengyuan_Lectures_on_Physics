# Lattice and Space Group

*Definition*:

- **$n$-dimensional (Bravais) lattice**: a subset of $\R^n$ construct by linear combinations of $n$ basis vectors with *integral* coefficients

    $$
    \{m_1 t_1 + \cdots m_n t_n \mid
    m_1,...,m_n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
    $$

It is isomorphic to a its own translation group, which is subgroup of the full translation group $\mathbb{T}$ of $\R^n$

$$
T = \{\tau_{m_1 t_1 + \cdots m_n t_n} \mid
m_1,...,m_n \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$

The lattice may have other symmetry operations that leave the origin invariant (i.e. the *point group* $G_0$ of the lattice). The collection of all these point operations and the discrete translations forms the **space group** in $\R^n$.
