# Group Cohomology

## Group Extension with Abelian Kernel

Consider the special case of extension of an *Abelian* group $A$

$$
1 \to A \xrightarrow{\mu} G 
\xrightarrow{\pi} B \to 1
$$

*Definition*: Let $G$ be a group.

- **Left $G$-module**: an *Abelian* group $M$ (written additively) together with a (left) action of $G$ on $M$ which is *compatible* with the Abelian structure of $M$

    $$
    \forall g\in G,\ \forall a,b \in M \quad 
    g(a+b) = g(a) + g(b)
    $$
