# Group Axioms

*Definition*:

- **Group**: a set $G$ with a binary relation (**group multiplication**) 

    $$
    G \times G \to G, \quad
    (a, b) \mapsto ab \in G
    $$
    
    which satisfied the following axioms: for all $a,b,c \in G$

    $$
    \begin{array}{r|l}
        \text{Associativity} & a(bc) = (ab)c
        \\[6pt] \hline \\[-6pt]
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Existence of} \\
            \text{(left) identity}
        \end{aligned} & 
        \exists\ 1 \in G, \ 1a = a
        \\[6pt] \hline \\[-6pt]
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Existence of} \\
            \text{(left) inverse}
        \end{aligned} & 
        \exists\ a^{-1} \in G, \ a^{-1}a = 1
    \end{array}
    $$

*Remark*: The left identity is the same as the right identity; the left inverse is also the same as the right inverse, i.e.

$$
\forall g \in G, \quad g1 = g, \quad gg^{-1} = 1
$$

</div>

*Proof*: For any $g \in G$

$$
g g^{-1} = (g^{-1})^{-1} g^{-1} g g^{-1}
= (g^{-1})^{-1} g^{-1} = 1
$$

Thus left inverse = right inverse. Then

$$
g 1 = g g^{-1} g = 1g = g
$$

Thus left identity = right identity. $\blacksquare$

## Subgroups

*Definition*:

- **Subgroup**: a subset $H$ of $G$ which still forms a group under the same multiplication rule of $G$, denoted by $H \le G$

    Every group has the following two uninteresting subgroups:

    - **Trivial subgroup** of $G$: $\{1\}$
    - **Improper subgroup** of $G$: $G$ itself

- **Proper subgroup** of $G$: subgroups of $G$ other than $\{1\}$ and $G$ itself, denoted by $H < G$. 

### Subgroup Generators

*Definition*: Let $X$ be a non-empty subset of $G$.

- **Subgroup generated by $X$**: the group consisting of $X$ and all possible combinations of the identity, elements in $X$ and their inverse. This group is denoted by $\expect{X}$.

<div class="result">

*Theorem*: All elements in $\expect{X}$ is of the form

$$
x_1^{m_1} \cdots x_n^{m_n} \quad
(m_1,...,m_n \in \{-1, 0, 1\})
$$

where $n$ is the number of elements in $X$. Note that $x_j^0$ is interpreted as the identity $1$.
