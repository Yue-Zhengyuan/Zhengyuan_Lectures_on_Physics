# Subgroups and Cosets

## Subgroups

*Definition*:

- **Subgroup**: a subset $H$ of $G$ which still forms a group under the same multiplication rule of $G$, denoted by $H \le G$

    Every group has the following two uninteresting subgroups:

    - **Trivial subgroup** of $G$: $\{1\}$
    - **Improper subgroup** of $G$: $G$ itself

- **Proper subgroup** of $G$: subgroups of $G$ other than $\{1\}$ and $G$ itself, denoted by $H < G$. 

### Subgroup Generators

*Definition*: Let $X$ be a non-empty subset of $G$.

- **Subgroup generated by $X$**: the group consisting of all elements of $X$ and all possible combinations of the identity, elements in $X$ and their inverse. This group is denoted by $\expect{X}$.

<div class="result">

*Theorem*: All elements in $\expect{X}$ is of the form

$$
x_1^{m_1} \cdots x_n^{m_n} \quad
(m_1,...,m_n \in \{-1, 0, 1\})
$$

where $n$ is the number of elements in $X$. Note that $x_j^0$ is interpreted as the identity $1$.

## Cosets

*Definition*:

- **Coset**: The set of group elements obtained by multiplying $g \in G$ on the left (or right) of a subgroup $H$ of $G$

    $$
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Left coset} &: gH = \{gh \mid h \in H\}
        \\
        \text{Right coset}&: Hg = \{hg \mid h \in H\}
    \end{align*}
    $$

    <div class="remark">

    *Remark*: The element $g$ is called the **representative element** of the coset. Obviously it is not unique, for we can pick any $h \in H$ and use $gh$ as the representative element, i.e. $gH = (gh)H$.

From the general theory of equivalence classes, we obtain:

<div class="result">

*Theorem*: (Lagrange) Let $H$ be a subgroup of (a finite group) $G$.

- Two cosets $g_1 H, g_2 H$ ($g_1, g_2 \in G$) are *either disjoint or the same*;
- $|H|$ divides $|G|$.

</div><br>

- **Index** of a subgroup $H$: the number of left/right cosets of H in G, denoted by $|G:H|$.
